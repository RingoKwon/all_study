  List now: 1 -> 2 -> NULL

  Exit inner loop (inner_node_current == NULL)

Line 459: outter_node = outter_node->next
          = first_2->next
          = NULL  ← outter_node is NOW NULL!

Line 460: inner_node_previous = NULL

Line 461: inner_node_current = NULL->next  ← TRYING TO USE NULL!
          CRASH!

=== THE BUG ===
After freeing the duplicate, outter_node->next became NULL
Then we set outter_node = NULL
Then we try to use NULL->next
CRASH!
