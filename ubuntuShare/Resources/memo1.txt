  4. Once stopped at the breakpoint, inspect the array:

    - Print the array address:
    (gdb) print &a
    - Print array contents:
    (gdb) print a
    - Examine memory as 10 decimal words:
    (gdb) x/10dw &a
    - Examine memory as 40 bytes in hexadecimal:
    (gdb) x/40xb &a
    - View the stack frame information:
    (gdb) info frame
    - View stack pointer and array location:
    (gdb) print $sp
  (gdb) print (void*)&a - (void*)$sp

  Memory examination format:

  The x command syntax is: x/[count][format][size] address
  - count: number of units to display
  - format: d (decimal), x (hex), t (binary), s (string), i
  (instruction)
  - size: b (byte), h (halfword), w (word), g (giant/8 bytes)

  This will show you exactly where a[10] is located on the
  stack and its contents!
